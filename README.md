Study Timetable Generator
This project is a Flask-based web application that generates personalized study timetables for students using OpenAI's GPT API. The app takes student-specific data such as field of study, subjects, learning styles, and more to create a comprehensive, adaptable, and goal-oriented study schedule.

Features
Personalized Timetable Creation: The app tailors a study timetable based on individual student data like subjects, learning styles, and challenges.
OpenAI API Integration: Leverages OpenAI’s GPT API to generate a dynamic, thoughtful study plan.
Multi-Student Support: The app allows you to input multiple students' data and generate a timetable for each.
Detailed Schedule: The generated timetable includes subject allocation, daily/weekly breakdown, and regular review periods to track progress.
Technology Stack
Backend: Python (Flask)
API: OpenAI GPT API (via requests library)
Environment Management: Python dotenv for managing API keys
Frontend: HTML templates rendered by Flask's render_template
Prerequisites
Before running the project, make sure you have the following:

Python 3.x installed.
An OpenAI API key. You can get it from OpenAI's platform.
Necessary Python libraries installed (Flask, requests, python-dotenv).
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/M-A-K-K/Social-Media-post-generator-.git
cd Social-Media-post-generator-
Set up a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv .venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
bash
Copy code
.venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source .venv/bin/activate
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your OpenAI API key:

Create a .env file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:
makefile
Copy code
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
Run the Flask app:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Open a browser and visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to access the app.

How It Works
Input the required details for each student, including:

Name
Field of study
Year of study
Subjects
Preferred learning styles
Personal objectives
Challenges
Extracurricular activities
The app sends this data to OpenAI's API, which responds with a personalized study timetable for each student.

The timetable includes:

Subject allocation
Adaptation to the student’s learning style
Alignment with personal objectives
Consideration of challenges and extracurricular activities
Weekly and daily breakdown
The generated timetable is displayed on the web page.

Example
Here is an example of a study timetable generated by the app:

text
Copy code
Monday:
  - 9:00 AM - 10:30 AM: Study Math (Lecture review and problem-solving)
  - 11:00 AM - 12:30 PM: Biology (Interactive activities based on learning style)
  ...

Weekly Progress Review: Sunday 4:00 PM - 5:00 PM
